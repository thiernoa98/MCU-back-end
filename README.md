It's time to put all of this course's knowledge together to create a fullstack application! In this lesson, we will create a Fullstack application by creating the back-end and front-end separately. They will communicate via URL requests, and will be in a ready-to-deploy state by the end of it.

## Overview

Before we begin, let's make sure all of the following software is open and ready to use during this process:

- A Browser (Chrome)
- VS Code
- MongoDB Compass
- Postman

## Server setup (back-end)

Let's begin by creating a server. This server will be attached to a database, and will act as an internal API for the front end. During this lesson, we will go back and forth between this folder and the front-end folder that we will create later. It might be helpful to have 2 windows of VS Code open during this.
